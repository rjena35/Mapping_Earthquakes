# Mapping Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a web page that displays earthquake data from the past 7 days. Map styles were curated from Mapbox, and GeoJSON served as the basis to help create the visuals.

## Results
The webpage is very interactive as users are able to toggle different aspects of the data, and show the data in different ways. The vaious layers that are integrated into the web page allow users to see the data in a variety of ways.
